NATO is not yet completely implemented and the strategists in Washington are blunt: as long as Germany is not rearmed, Western Europe will not be capable of containing a Soviet invasion.<br>
The European armies are simply too weak.<br>
On the basis of the friendly American pressure, a treaty was drafted to enable the management of their own defence by the Europeans.<br>
This treaty however contains certain clauses that have a teeth-gnashing aspect for our country.<br>
Our citizens are not yet ready to see Germany rearming itself and the governance mechanisms of this community seem to threathen the independence of our national defence. <br>
