The party's clandestine cells come into operation and the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) are reactivated.<br>
Many efforts are deployed to make the roads to the capital impassable and many bridges are destroyed.<br>
The government just decreed general mobilisation of the Parisian population who, supervised by the peasants and workers militias, is immediately assigned to antitank trench-digging and barricades building.<br>
The Compagnies de gendarmerie are ordered to elect gendarmes councils tasked to assist the generals with their commanding duties.<br>
Stockpiles of Molotov cocktails are collected in a fortified National Assembly...<br>
The silliest actions and orders come one after another in the greatest disorder. The government has close to zero visibility on what is really implemented or not...<br>
A crowd of reactionaries just \"liberated\" General de Gaulle and, even if nobody knows where the hero of Free France currently is, Maurice Thorez announced over the radio that the general defected to the fascist forces.<br>
This announcement, instead of rallying the army around the government, had the oppposite effect: the units which were still wavering are now joining the mutineers' side en masse.

From Maurice Thorez, 
« …if the Soviet army defending the cause of people, the cause of socialism, was led to battle the aggressors to our soil, could the workers, the people of France, behave differently to the Red Army than the peoples of Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, etc.?  »<br>
In a very logical move given the desperate situation, the President of the Council personally called upon Stalin, \"brilliant builder of socialism, the beloved leader of workers around the world,\" to save the legitimate government of France from the fascist aggression.<br>
The Vojd immediately answered the call by making an old DC-3 available for the Central committee of the PCF for immediate exfiltration to Moscow.<br>
This was not exactly the answer expected by the French communists...

The PCF line is lambasted by its communist friends while its pursuit of the socialist alliance and its \"parliamentary illusion\" are condemned.<br>
The Yugoslavians are the most virulent: why does France do not make the revolution? What are the French comrades doing?<br>
For the French Marcel Cachin, these criticisms are unfair: should the Red Army have entered Paris, then the situation would have been like in Yugoslavia.<br>
This meeting led to a strict clarification by comrade Zhdanov: «The goal of the United States is the consolidation of the world domination of the American imperialism.»<br>
