Israel and Egypt finally agreed on peace by signing accords under our mediation at Camp David.<br>
What a brilliant success for diplomacy and President Carter who saved several times the negotiations from a dead-end.<br>
Israel made concessions over Sinai and Egypt over Cisjordania.
Middle East will never look the same anymore... will it?

Egypt and Israel did not manage to come to a mutual understanding, each one standing its ground.<br>
The political necessity to leave space for contestation at home forced the stakeholders to make their positions harder.<br>
Our mediation role was also questioned: each party accused us of favouring the other side.<br>
These negotiations are a sad failure for the U.S. State Department and for President Carter who was personally involved in these peace talks.

The Vietnamese regime's radicalness and the national economic difficulties cause numerous departures. <br>
In sometimes terrifying conditions, thousands of emigrants flee their country on overloaded boats.<br>
Many of them will perish at sea.<br> This phenomenon does not look like it will end anytime soon and, it was to go on at the same rate, Vietnam could lose tenths of thousand inhabitants.<br>
Obviously, nobody still has any illusions about the very nature of those regimes set up in Asia.<br>

The Iranian society is shaken by violent demonstrations.<br>
The economy is undermined by inflation and the austery measures imposed by the government are leading the country on the brink of chaos.<br>
There has been many casualties among the demonstrators as the forces of law and order do not have appropriate anti-riot equipment.<br>
Should we assure the Shah of our full support when some in Washington think he is incapable of managing this crisis and should instead leave?

While the martial law has been proclaimed, an immense crowd invaded the streets of Teheran.<br>
The new anti-riot equipment provided by us have been used extensively.<br>
Smoke bombs, water cannons, truncheons: the complete suppression and crowd control kit was tested on the field by the Iranian forces of law and order.<br>
They were sometimes locally overwhelmed but they held steady in the end.<br>
Even if there was many injuries, no death is be to deplored! <br>

While the martial law has been proclaimed, an immense crowd invaded the streets of Teheran.<br>
The forces of law and order, overwhelmed, shot in the crowd, causing many casualties.<br>
This day will remain in the Iranian collective memory as the\"Black Friday\".<br>
Faced with such violence, the last supporters of the Shah are abandoning him one after another.<br>
Will the Iranian dynasty survive this day?
