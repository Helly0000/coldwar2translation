$texte1980a="
Our economy is going through difficulties while we face a galloping inflation.<br>
The government thinks the national economy can be revitalised through a generous tax policy and an expended budget.<br>
Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, is rather advocating for a monetary policy and 
an increase of the prime rate (the federal net interest rate set on a daily basis by the FED).
<br> All in all, the question is as follow: <br>
should we attack this stagflation head on by stimulating  our economy as the risk of a skyrocketting inflation or should we instead fight inflation, possibly triggering a recession?

America is the driving force of this world and this driving force must not stop!<br>
The money machines are overheating and public procurement experiences high growth.<br>
Wages however struggle to keep the pace, and the cheap American goods for which the national market is now too small are taking over the entire world.<br>
Our economic partners, faced with a deteriorating trade balance in our favour, are tempted by protectionist measures.

The system overheated, it must be brought to an immediate stop!<br>
The Federal Reserve has just sharply increased its discount rate and compulsory bank set-aside amount.<br>
Money is becoming rarer and more expensive.<br>
The countries in debt to U.S. banks risk seing their financial situation deteriorating.

The Soviets unveiled their warmongering intentions in Afghanistan!<br>
This brutal invasion can remain unpunished!<br>
President Carter contemplates a triple embargo to isolate the USSR:<br>
-On phosphates<br>
-On cereals<br>
-On technological products<br>
The embargo on cereals could have an adverse effect on our own agriculture sector and compensations will have to be envisaged if we decide to go forward with this option.<br>
However, is it wise to penalise our exports while our economy is already stagnating?

$texte1980b1="
The Soviets face a deficit in tons of cereals which is over 27 millions.<br>
Our embargo should be enough to force them into reconsidering their policy.<br>
The American farmers even seem to support the embargo because they are satisfied with the promised compensations.<br>
Most of the Western States will follow our lead: success is undeniable!<br>
...<br>
Unfortunately, some third countries which are large cereals producers appear to be ready to take advantage of this golden opportunity and replace us...
<br>The technological embargo will be harder to circumven.
";

$titre1980b2="EMBARGO";

$texte1980b2="
Our agriculture would have suffered too much from a cereals embargo.<br>
The technological embargo should be more efficient and harder to circumvent.<br>

Iran still holds 53 Americans hostages.<br>
General Vaught just set out his plan to free the hostages.<br>
This would be a complex operation, necessitating to set up temporary advanced air bases in Iranian territory.<br>

While the operation was underway, repeated mechanical defects forced the rescue forces to abandon several helicopters.<br>
A violent dust and sand cloud was the final nail on the coffin for the entire operation and the remaining helicopters.<br>
This phenomenon is not rare in this country...<br>
The number of operational aircrafts deemed insufficient, the operation was cancelled.<br>
During the evacuation phase, the collision between a C-130 and a helicopter killed 8 of our men and left two wrecks in the Iranian desert...<br>
To make this whole failure a catastrophy, confidential documents were abandoned on-site in this atmosphear of panic...<br>
We should consider our agents in Iran definitively compromised.

The balance of terror fails to convince the American people: they fear the spike of tension between the East and the West could lead to a nuclear holocaust.<br>
Pacifism gains ground in the USA, 800,000 persons refused to enrol on the military incorporation lists.<br>
Regular demonstrations take place in front of the Pentagon and, lately, militants even slipped into a nuclear warheads factory to destroy warheads.<br>
Europe has not been spared from these movements (supported by Moscow).<br>
The rallying cry of \"Better Red than dead\" can even be heard among German protesters.<br>
The invasion of Afghanistan has cracked the Western block and several West-European countries will not follow the USA in case of a crisis with the USSR.

As soon as January, the dissenter Andrei Sakharov called for a worlwide boycott of the Moscow Olympic games to protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br>
Our country, along many others, is also considering the idea to boycott these games: how could we possibly participate when the Afghan people is being destroyed with bombs.<br>

Independent trade unions are created; the right to strike is authorised; political prisoners are released...<br>
In return, the trade unions accept  to recognise the party's role and the existing alliances with the USSR.<br>
No matter what they might say, the Communist Party of Poland is discredited and can no longer claim to represent the workers.<br>
These Gdansk agreements threaten the entire communist system!<br>
Our divisions are gathered at the Polish border, ready to issue a reality check. However, we have reasons to hesitate:

With a view to put an end to disorder, we answered the pressing call of our Polish comrades overwhelmed by a factious agitation organised by the imperialists.<br>
Our intervention however met an unexpected resistance!<br>
Trade union militias welcomed our tanks with Molotov cocktails; it also seems a part of the Polish defected and established roadblocks on our way...<br>
