Fidel Castro is visiting Washington!<br>
		He intends to convince and reassure us about his intentions.<br>
		We nonetheless have legitimate worries about his governance: summary executions sullied the Cuban revolution and the government's political programme contains projects not to our liking. Castro notably plans a large agrarian reform that would forbid foreigners to own pieces of land in Cuba.<br>
		The United Fruit and several other companies could be expropriated!<br>
		Fidel Castro however declares himself anticommunist but not all his companions do.

The President accepted to see Fidel Castro despite his reluctance to meet him.<br>
During the press conference, the Cuban leader advocated for a constructive dialogue with the United States of America but certain private discussions worried the Department of State.<br>

Everything is going wrong between the Tibetan population and the Party: <br>
In Lhassa, rumours around the kidnapping of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, by the authorities sparked riots which are on the verge of degenerating.<br>

This movement has pronounced anti-Chinese and anti-Party characteristics and it is obvious that American imperialist agents are behind it.<br>
