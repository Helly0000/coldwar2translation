In Geneva, negotiations opened with Viet Minh representatives for peace in Indochina.<br>
The country would be split in two entities and we would evacuate Indochina.<br>
The French public opinion is tired of this war and its cost starts to be heavy burden for the nation.<br>
Do we want this peace?

$texte1954u="
The Algerian territory has just been shaken by an unprecedent wave of terrorist attacks!<br>
No less than 70 attacks took place, against military facilities as much as against civilians: teachers, forest guards, taxi drivers...<br>
A National Liberation Front is behind these bloody attacks which will not remain unpunished.<br>
« One does not compromise when it comes to defending the internal peace of the nation, the unity and integrity of the Republic. The Algerian departments are part of the French Republic. They have been French for a long time, and they are irrevocably French. ... Between them and metropolitan France there can be no conceivable secession.»

« It is not difficult for the Arabs, if they free themselves from the nightmare of communism, to discover an Arab socialism emanating from their soul, (…) at the service of Arab nationalism and as an essential factor to its resurrection.»<br>
<span style=\"font-style:italic;\" >Michel Aflaq</span><br>
An Arab and socialist resurrection party - the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party - starts to matter in the Syrian political life and grows in number across the Arab world.<br>
This Ba'ath party intends to be socialist but in the Arab way: it recognises the role of the Islam religion in the Arab culture but sees itself as a lay party; it advocates for a strong nationalism but on the scale of the entire Arab world.<br>
With Ba'athism, the Arab may have found a credible alternative to the Western ideologies and Marxism-Leninism.<br>
