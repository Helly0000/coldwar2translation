The United States of America decided to make the human rights as the cornerstone of their foreign policy…<br>
These know-it-alls had already been promoting this theme during our talks in Helsinki. And here they come re-entering the fray!<br>

The USA are not playing a fair game with us. Their demands are nothing but lies to cover their malicious intentions to undermine the USSR's moral authority.<br>
Jimmy Carter was invited to rather focus on the Afro-Americans and jeopardised workers rights in his country, before lecturing the entire world.

Given the evolution of the economic situation in the world proving that Capitalism is on its knees, we have no interest in sparing the American imperialists.<br>
History will prove us right.

The time has come for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians to resume.<br>
The Palestinian issue is complexifying the civil war in Lebanon and makes this region a perpetual powder keg.<br>
UN Resolution 242 remains unapplied and Israel refused to discuss with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).<br>
However, the Palestinian movement - without going as far as recognising Israel, appears ready to do some significant gestures toward a fragile peace.

That is a first!<br>
The Egyptian President, Anwar El Sadat, is officially visiting Israel!<br>
This is an unprecedented initiative showing Egypt's willingness to bring peace closer.<br>
However, the Arab countries reacted very negatively to this initiative: El Sadat's gesture is considered a betrayal.<br>
