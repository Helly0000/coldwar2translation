$texte1979a="
Mao is no longer the Chinese leader; it is time to establish real diplomatic relations with this country.<br>
Recognising the People's Republic of China requires us to acknowledge it at the one \"true China\", of which Taiwan - where the Republic of China government rules - is an integral part.<br>
Such a gesture will worry the Soviets as much as the Taiwanese.<br>
Should we take the plunge?

$texte1979a1="
This was the way of the world.<br>
In order not to alarm the Soviets, these relations will be strictly political, to the great displeasure of our National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wished to use this rapprochement in a military manner to put further pressure on the USSR.

We lived over 20 years without recognising the PRC, we can surely wait for another 20 years.

$titre1979b="THREE MILE ISLAND";

$texte1979b="
The number 2 reactor core of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant partly melted down, triggering a chain reaction in the power plant.
<br>Fortunately, this accident was, not without harm, contained...
<br>Even if this incident only had a direct local impact, it proves the incompetence of the American nuclear security and gives new ammunations to antinuclear movements across the world.
<br>We should stop the construction of new nuclear power plants.

$titre1979b1="THREE MILE ISLAND";

$texte1979b1="
Over 200,000 persons were evacuated as a safety precaution.<br>
There was a lot (too much) of improvisation in these evacuations but we will learn useful lessons from them in improving our security procedures.<br>
The antinuclear movements experience a spike of activity and surveys prove their arguments are successfully reaching the population's ears...

";

$titre1979b2="THREE MILE ISLAND";

$texte1979b2="
The President acknowlegded the danger and the population's concern. He did the right thing: the construction of new nuclear power plant has officially been abandoned.<br>
We can easily live without nuclear energy. After all, petrol is cheap!

$titre1979c="THE SECOND OIL CRISIS";

$texte1979c="
The unrest in Iran strongly impacted the world price of oil: the prices of petroleum products simply doubled in six months!<br>
As the prices are skyrocketting, each country attempts to build up its strategic reserves.<br>
Japan particularly depends on the Iranian oil. Its economy is severely affected by this crisis.

$titre1979d="THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS";

$texte1979d="
Our embassy in Teheran has been assaulted by Iranian students!<br>
The Marines were rapidly overcome by the crowd: 52 members of our embassy have been captured and are held hostages.<br>
Many confidential documents fell into the Iranian hands.<br>
Iran's demand is simple: the Shah in exchange for the hostages!<br>
(The Shah is currently on our territory for medical reasons)

$titre1979d1="THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS";

$texte1979d1="
Our response was very firm: the importations of Iranian petrol were immediately stopped and a large number of Iranian nations deported our of our territory.<br>
The Iranian funds in American banks are frozen until further notice.<br>
Even if 13 hostages have been released since the assault, negotiations are bogged down and the new Iranian governement does not seem the least impressed by these retaliatory measures...<br>
This crisis seems set to continue.

$titre1979e="SHTORM-333";

$texte1979e="
Afghanistan is struggling with a rebellion and the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council is not to be trusted.<br>
Hafizullah Amin dismissed and killed his rivals within the Communist Party. He seems ready to distance himself from Moscow to get closer to Washington.<br>
Additionally, this people's republic is threatened by Islamist movements inspired by the Iranian revolution.<br>
We would not want to see the Islamic gangrene reach the southern USSR republics via a weak Afghanistan.<br>
A plan (Shtorm-333) is already ready to get rid of Hafizullah Amin and consolidate the communist regime.

$texte1979e1="
The operation was well-conducted. Our special forces, the Spetsnaz, took control of the presidential palace and eliminated Hafizullah Amin.<br>
His successor, Babrak Karmal, will surely prove himself more loyal.<br>
In parallel to this successful operation, the Red Army entered Afghanistan overland and is busy taking position in all strategic locations of the country.
";

$titre1979e2="SHTORM-333";

$texte1979e2="
Hafizullah Amin's regime is multiplying the political faux-pas and his policy (State atheism, literacy teaching and women rights...) upsets the Afghan traditional society.<br>
Revolt is smouldering, this government will not last long.

$titre1979f="THE INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN";

$texte1979f="
The Soviets have just invaded Afghanistan!<br>
In a few days, they seized the capital city and put their man in power: Babrak Karmal.<br>
The USSR justifies its invasion by the intervention requests received from the Afghan government and by the necessity to stabilise a country threatened by seditious movements.
<br>The Arab States protest and the UNO condemns this intervention.<br>
The Thaw comes to end as the Red Army sets up in the country...
