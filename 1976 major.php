The main European communist parties' leaders have lost their mind!<br>
Enrico Berlinguer, from the Italian Communist Party, demanded a 'pluralist' socialist system in front of the participants of the 25th Congress of the Communist Party!<br>
Georges Marchais, from the French Communist Party, not being outdone, publicly renounced to the dictatorship of the proletariat.<br>
The European communist parties, tired of being kept away from power, are looking for alliances and rapprochements with socialist parties.<br>
One day, we may see communists in Western European governments elected by citizens.<br>
But what about the revolution in all of this?<br>
These parties should not forget what they owe us, nor where there funds come from.";

These parties will quickly get back on the right track when they will realise that their new 'friends' want to get hold of their electorate.<br>
By relying on the true bolsheviks who are left in these parties and by being carefully when distributing funds, we should be able to halt this despicable drift.";

In their speeches, the Western Europe communist parties are progressively distancing themselves from us...<br>
The few true bolsheviks left in these parties feel abandoned and betrayed by us.";

Two American soldiers were shot by North Korean soldiers while attempting to chop down a poplar tree obstructing the line of sight of UN observation post on the DMZ between the two Koreas!<br>
This outrage cannot be left unpunished!<br>
We should dispatch an armed detachment with heavy support to get rid of that three.<br>
Obviously, such a force deployment in this area could easily run out of control and spark a war.";

On 21st, at 01:00am, engineers from the 2nd Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division - supported by helicopters, jet fighters, infrantrymen and members of the South Korean special forces - overcame the poplar tree of discord.

<br>
As our men were preparing to return to the base, a sustained machinegun fire targeted them - triggering immediate retaliation from the comabt helicopters.<br>
While military escalation seems to have gone out of control along the DMZ, the North Korean leader decreed general conscription and denounced an imperialist attack.<br>
In several places of the border, the North Korean army went on offensive well beyond the 38th parallel!
<br>
This invasion had obviosuly been premeditated : the communists waggered that our war exhaustion and the weakening of the U.S. Presidency would prevent us from reacting effectively.

The poplar tree incident was an isolated one and, wisely, the government refused to enter childish and pointless escalation.

With the death of Zhou Enlai, this is a page of Chinese History that is turning.<br>
The Chinese political world is merciless, even to dead people: the enemies of Zhou launched a \"Five Nos!\" campaign (no to wearing black armbands, no to funeral wreaths, no to mourning halls, no to remembrance activities and no to displaying Zhou's photographs).<br>
This call hurted the feelings the Chinse kept for Zhou Enlai and to the respect of ancestors, triggering impressive demonstrations across China: over 600,000 people marched in Nanjing to honour his memory!<br>
This contestation is even supported inside the party, showing that yesterday's customes are not longer tolerated...<br>
Jiang Qing, Mao's companion and responsible for starting this campaign, can do nothing more but get enraged and take notice of the loss of her influence.<br><br>

... And the least one can say is that China was exhausted tired of her Chairman.<br>
His dead body was barely cold that the struggle for power resumed within the party.<br>
The new strong man of China, Hua Guofeng, undertakes to get the country definitely done with the Maoist era by having the \"Gang of Four\" (led by Jiang Qing, Mao's companion) arrested.<br>
He does however not intend to succumb to the sirens of reformation and spend a lot of energy to keep in check Deng Xiaoping, the pragmatic reformer and his many supporters.<br>
