Tides are turning in the Iran-Iraq conflict.<br>
The Iraqi army fell back on the border and the Iranian are now vigorously counterattacking.<br>

The martial capabilities of the Iraqi army leave a lot to be desired: our analysts think there is now a real risk for Iraq to lose this war.<br>
The Iranian population greatly outnumbers its neighbour and, even more, they are fanaticised. True human waves are unfurling on the Iraqi Army and are eventually overwhelming its defence lines.<br>
Desperate after its proposals of truce have all been turned down, the Iraqi regime just established a maritime exclusion zone north of the Persian Gulf.<br>
Its effects were immediate: the Lloyd's insurance company tripled its premiums for all ships operating in the area.<br>
If this war was to block one of the main route for oil trade, an escalation and a intervention of the great powers would be inevitable.
